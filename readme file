# 🌦️ Weather Web App

A responsive weather web application built using **HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript** that displays real-time weather information for different cities.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was built as a hands-on learning exercise to understand how APIs, JavaScript, and UI frameworks like Bootstrap work together in a real-world application.

I started by using **Bootstrap templates** to quickly set up a clean and responsive UI layout.

## 🔄 API & Development Journey (What I Learned)

### 1️⃣ Initial API Choice – API Ninja (Rapid Weather API)

Initially, I used the **Rapid Weather API by API Ninja**.  
However, I discovered that it retrieves weather data using **latitude and longitude instead of city names**, which made it inconvenient for implementing a simple city-based search feature.

Because of this limitation, I decided to switch APIs.

---

### 2️⃣ Final API Choice – OpenWeather API

I then integrated the **OpenWeather API**, which:
- Allows fetching weather data directly using **city names**
- Is **free to use**
- Is more suitable for beginner-friendly and user-focused applications

This significantly improved the usability of the project.

### 3️⃣ Bootstrap & Console Issue

While developing the project, I initially faced an issue where **weather values were not appearing in the browser console**.

After debugging, I realized the issue was related to **Bootstrap not loading properly** when using CDN links.

To fix this:
- I downloaded the **Bootstrap ZIP files**
- Added them locally to the project (`css/` and `js/` folders)
- Linked them correctly in the HTML file

After this change, the JavaScript executed correctly and the API values started appearing in the console as expected.

This helped me understand:
- How external libraries affect script execution
- The importance of correct file linking
- Debugging using the browser console
